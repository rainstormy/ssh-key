# It validates the software quality.
#
# It is triggered automatically by pull requests opened towards the `main` branch.
#
# It can be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub CLI:
#
#   gh workflow run ci.yml [--ref <branch-name>]
#   gh run watch
#
# It can be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub web interface:
